  <b> Favorite CMSC subject so far: </b>
   <p> My favorite CMSC subject so far has been CMSC 22. Since my first year as a BSCS students, most coding outputs I have done were terminal-based. What made CMSC 22 stand out for me is the possibility of creating a graphical user interface for my project. It made my project feel a lot more legitimate. <p>
  <b> Favorite GE so far: </b>
   <p> I have enjoyed PI10 the most. I took this course back when I was a freshman from another degree program here in UPLB. My instructor at the time, Ma'am Lara, really seemed like she knew every detail of Rizal's life, which made learning it a lot more interesting. And most importantly, I got a 1.25 grade on that course haha. </p>
  <b> Favorite PL: </b>
   <p> I would say JAVA has been really fun to work with. I used it mainly for my OOP course. I find it a lot more workable and with the ample level of complexity for my dumb brain to use. </p>
  <b> Favorite food: </b>
   <p> I am not a picky eater. So I would say, any dish that has chicken in it. </p>
